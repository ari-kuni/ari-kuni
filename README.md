## About Me

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Bioengineering with a focus on **bioengineering**, **mechanical systems**, and **programming**.  
Whether it's building simulations, writing technical reports, or prototyping in the makerspace — I love turning ideas into tangible outcomes.

- 💻 Coding languages I use: `Python`, `MATLAB`, `C++`
- 🔧 Software I use: `Fusion 360`, `ImageJ`, `AutoCAD`
- 🧪 Interests: `Anything I can get my grimy little hands on`
